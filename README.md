 A space shooter to learn Godot for future projects.
 This game is incredibly minimalist and only consists of the one game state, there is no game over or high score screen. I've reached a point where I'm comfortable with Godot enough that I can pursue larger projects that I am more interested in.
 
 ### Running the game
 
 **It is currently ported for Linux and Windows and you can open the game by opening the export folder and using the compressed windows_port or linux_port.**
 
 Inside the zipped files is an optional settings document which gives you the option to change in game options like movement speed, enemy health, rainbow bullet mode, etc. **the values typed must match the no spaces format. so x = 5 is invalid and should be x=5.**
 
 ### Controls
 The mouse aims where your bullets go.
 
 WASD moves your character.
 
 ### Viewing the code
 I tried to organize the scene file (.TSCN) with the object code (.GD) the .TSCN won't be viewable without having installed Godot but the .GD will and contains the actual code. **to find the code navigate to the Scenes folder and open any folder within it to find the .GD files**
 
 ### Why Godot?
 Godot is incredibly similar to python which makes game programming more convienent than languages like c#. It's also great that most of the programming can be standalone without too much reliance on the UI of Godot. I also thought that Godot was the best 2d game development engine even when compared to older, more established engines like Unity.
